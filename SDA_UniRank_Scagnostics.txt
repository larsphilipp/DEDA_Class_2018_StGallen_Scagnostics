Description: "This uses the Financial Times Master in Management 2018 Ranking data to apply and develop methods in Scagnostics such as the Minimum Spanning Tree and Convex / Concave Hulls.
The code was written within 1 week and is up to further development (see comments #TO DO in the code). The plotting works quiet well.
However, it is the key figure C that needs inputs as area and edge length from these plots, which we have not been able to provide yet."
